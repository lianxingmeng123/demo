## Why Restapify

When you start a new frontend project when the backend is not yet ready, you quickly come to the question of how to retrieve the data to be displayed. There are then many solutions that come with advantages but also some inconveniences. It's possible to use a tool like [postman](https://www.postman.com/) but it's not 100% free and require an account, to simply fetch local JSON data but it only supports a `GET` request or use a mocker library like [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), [mocker-api](https://github.com/jaywcjlove/mocker-api) or [http-fake-backend](https://github.com/micromata/http-fake-backend). 

The problem of most of this libraries is the way you have to define your API endpoints (a single file for all the routes, javascript files that took almost the same time to code than the real API, ...). Restapify try to make this process even faster with a file structure close to the one that you can see in [Nextjs](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) or [Sapper](https://github.com/sveltejs/sapper) and some developer friendly syntaxes to populate your json files.
